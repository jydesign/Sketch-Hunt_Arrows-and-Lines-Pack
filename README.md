# Sketch Hunt Arrows and Lines Pack

**New Version 2 with Resizable Sketch Symbols & Craft Color Styles**

_Version 2.0 – last updated September 5, 2016_

Version 2 of our Arrows and Lines Pack is here! As we’ve said before, arrowhead styling on native lines in Sketch app needs improvement. We’ve updated our popular kit to take advantage of Sketch app 39.x scalable symbols. In addition, when paired with the InVision Craft plugin, you can easily update the color of all elements via the Styles artboard.

This free download was created with the goal of helping out Sketch users by offering a selection of pre-built common arrowhead shapes and lines for wireframing. These hand-tooled vector arrow objects have been designed for flexibility:

- **New** Scalable symbols for Sketch 39.x
- **New** A set of 9 lines and arrows for wireframes
- **New** Optionally use Craft to update global color style
- A variety of arrowhead shapes similar to traditional print and digital designs
- Each basic arrow uses a 2px line
- All elements were created and arranged using whole-pixel values, for easy scaling
- Lines are separate from arrowheads, for ease in extending and editing
- Bonus elements: stylized arrows for diagrams
